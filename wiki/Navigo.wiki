The "navigo" script included in *cardpeek* is specifically targeted to read the content of Navigo cards used in Paris. It provides enhanced "event log" analysis notably with subway/train station names, as illustrated in the screenshot above. It has been successfully tested on Navigo Découverte, Navigo and Navigo Intégrale cards.

= Notes =
The "navigo" script included in *cardpeek* a specialized version of the calypso script also provided in *cardpeek*, which allows to read the contents of transport cards used in many cities.
You must use the contact interface to read a Navigo card, because they cannot be read with a normal conctactless card-reader (these cards use a specific protocol that is not fully compatible with ISO 14443 B). 

= Privacy notes =

These transport cards keep an "event log" describing at least 3 of the last stations/stops you have been through. This "event log", which could pose a privacy risk, is not protected by any access control means and is freely readable.
Note however that your name does not appear on the card (to our best knowledge).
