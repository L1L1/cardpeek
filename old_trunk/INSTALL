This program was tested under Linux debian version 5 only.

Compile and install instructions:

1) Make sure you have the following dev. packages :
  - libgtk 2.0 (http://www.gtk.org)
  - liblua 5.1 (http://www.lua.org)
  - libpcsclite (http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/)

2) change dir. to the source directory

2) type "make"

3) the binary executable is 'cardtree', use it directly or copy to the
proper path.

4) When first running 'cardpeek', the program will attempt to create the
'.cardpeek' directory in your home directory. This is normal.
